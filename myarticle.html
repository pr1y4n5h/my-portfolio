            A server is a computer software or a machine that offers services to other programs or devices, referred to
            as ‚Äúclients‚Äú. There are different types of servers: web servers, database servers, application servers,
            cloud computing servers, file servers, mail servers, DNS servers and much more. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The usage share for Unix-like operating systems has over the years greatly improved, predominantly on
            servers, with Linux distributions at the forefront. Today a bigger percentage of servers on the Internet and
            data centers around the world are running a Linux-based operating system.

        <h3>Some of the key features of Linux are :</h3>

                Linux Is Free
            </li>
            <p>
                The free upgrade that Microsoft offered a couple of years ago has run out. This means you now have to
                pay for it. Many manufacturers ship computers with Windows 10 installed. If you are happy with your
                current computer, the only way to get a new operating system is to pay for the latest version of Windows
                or download and install Linux for free.
            </p>
            <li class="blogli">
                Security
            </li>
            <p>
                While no operating system is completely risk-free, Windows is a big target for developers of viruses and
                malware. There is little that Microsoft can do about this issue. As such, you must install an antivirus
                application and firewall software which eats into your memory and CPU usage as the constant stream of
                downloads required to keep this software up to date. With Linux, you only need to be clever, stick to
                trusted software repositories, and avoid using risky programs such as Adobe Flash.
            </p>
            <li class="blogli">
                Performance
            </li>
            <p>
                Linux, even with all the effects and shiny features of modern desktop environments, runs faster than
                Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. Users are becoming less reliant on the desktop and more reliant on the web.
                Do you need all your processing power taken up with the operating system, or do you want something with
                a lighter footprint, letting you get on with your work and play?
            </p>
            <li class="blogli">
                Reliability
            </li>
            <p>
                Windows is not as reliable as Linux. How many times have you, as a Windows user, had a program hang, and
                when you try to close it from the Task Manager (assuming you can get it to open), it remains open, and
                it takes several attempts to close the offending program? With Linux, each application is
                self-contained, and you can kill any application with the XKill command.
            </p>
            <li class="blogli">
                Support
            </li>
            <p>
                Microsoft has a lot of documentation, but when you get stuck, you may need to search their forums, and
                other people may have asked a question that has no good answers. It isn't that Microsoft's support is
                bad; on the contrary, it is in-depth and good. The truth is, however, that they employ people to offer
                support, and there is only so much money that is budgeted for this support, and the wealth of knowledge
                is spread thinly. Linux support is easier to find, and there are dozens of forums, hundreds of chat
                rooms, and even more websites dedicated to helping people learn and understand Linux.
